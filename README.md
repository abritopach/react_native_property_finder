# React-Native-Property-Finder

Sample project that shows how to handle React native from Tom Elliot [Tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/126063/react-native-tutorial).

This project has been developed to practice and improve my skills.

NOTE: Currently this project has only been tested on Android devices.
