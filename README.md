# React-Native-Property-Finder

Sample project that shows how to handle React native from Tom Elliot [Tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/126063/react-native-tutorial).

This project has been developed to practice and improve my skills.

NOTE: Currently this project has only been tested on Android devices.

## Running

Before you go through this example, you should have at least a basic understanding of React Native concepts. You must also already have React Native installed on your machine.

```bash
react-native start --reset-cache
react-native run-android
```
